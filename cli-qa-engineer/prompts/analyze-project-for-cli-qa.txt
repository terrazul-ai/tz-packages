Analyze this project to identify CLI testing requirements. Return a flat JSON object where every value is a string.

Examine the codebase for:
1. CLI entry points (bin scripts, main commands)
2. Subcommands and their arguments
3. Interactive prompts or wizards
4. Configuration file handling
5. Environment variable usage
6. Output formats (JSON, table, plain text)
7. Error handling patterns

{
  "cliEntryPoint": "primary CLI command or script path",
  "subcommands": "comma-separated list of subcommands",
  "hasInteractivePrompts": "yes or no",
  "interactivePatterns": "patterns that indicate prompts (e.g., ? for inquirer)",
  "configFiles": "comma-separated list of config file patterns",
  "envVars": "comma-separated list of environment variables used",
  "outputFormats": "comma-separated list of output formats supported",
  "errorPatterns": "common error message patterns",
  "testableCommands": "comma-separated list of commands safe to test",
  "destructiveCommands": "comma-separated list of commands that modify state"
}

Only include information you can confidently determine from the codebase.
If a field cannot be determined, use "unknown" as the value.
