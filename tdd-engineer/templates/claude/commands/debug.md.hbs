Debug an error or issue in the codebase.

Usage: `/debug [error message or file path]`

Steps:
1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - If an error message is provided, analyze the stack trace
   - If a file path is provided, check IDE diagnostics for that file
   - Gather context about when and how the error occurs

2. **Reproduce** (if possible):
   - Try to reproduce the error
   - Identify minimal reproduction steps
   - Note any patterns or conditions

3. **Analyze**:
   - Read the failing code
   - Check recent changes (git log)
   - Review related code and dependencies
   - Look for common error patterns
   - Use IDE diagnostics to check for type errors, lint warnings

4. **Diagnose Root Cause**:
   - Identify what's actually wrong (not just symptoms)
   - Consider edge cases, race conditions, timing issues
   - Check assumptions and validation

5. **Suggest Fix**:
   - Propose concrete solutions
   - Explain why the fix works
   - Consider alternative approaches
   - Add tests to prevent regression

Provide a structured debug report:
- **Problem**: Clear description of the issue
- **Root Cause**: What's actually wrong
- **Analysis**: How you identified the problem
- **Proposed Fix**: Concrete solution with code examples
- **Prevention**: Tests or checks to prevent recurrence
- **Alternatives**: Other possible solutions considered

Use the debugger agent's systematic approach and leverage mcp__ide__getDiagnostics for additional insights.
