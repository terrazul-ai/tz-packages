Run a Codex pre-push review for a GitHub issue.

Usage: `/codex-review <issue-number>`

This command runs OpenAI Codex locally to review your current changes against a GitHub issue.

Steps:

1. **Validate Input**:
   - Ensure an issue number is provided: `$ARGUMENTS`
   - If no issue number, ask the user for one

2. **Run the Review Script**:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/skills/codex-review/run.sh $ARGUMENTS
   ```

3. **Present Results**:
   - Display the structured review output from Codex
   - Highlight any **Blockers** that must be fixed before push
   - Summarize **Important** items and **Nits**
   - List any **Missing tests** that should be added

4. **Follow Up**:
   - If blockers were found, offer to help fix them
   - If missing tests were identified, offer to create them using the TDD workflow
   - Do not push until all blockers are resolved
