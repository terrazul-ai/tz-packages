# PR Followup

**PR Link/Number**: $ARGUMENTS

> **Instructions**: Take a look at the PR review and address all of the review and inline comments.
> **Important**: The future is now—any improvements or "future" recommendations must be addressed **immediately**.

## Steps

1. **Fetch PR Details**:
   - If GitHub MCP server is available, use `mcp__github__get_pull_request` and `mcp__github__get_pull_request_comments` to fetch PR details and comments
   - Otherwise, use the `gh` CLI: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>`
   - Extract the repository owner/name from the current git remote if not provided

2. **Gather All Feedback**:
   - Get the main PR review summary/comments
   - Get all inline code comments with their file locations and line numbers
   - Identify the reviewer(s) and their concerns
   - Note any requested changes vs suggestions

3. **Categorize Comments**:
   - **Must Address**: Requested changes, blocking issues, bugs
   - **Should Address**: Suggestions marked as "future" or "nice to have" (treat as immediate)
   - **Clarifications**: Questions that need responses

4. **Address Each Comment**:
   - For code changes: Make the fix and note the file:line reference
   - For questions: Add clarifying comments or respond in the PR
   - For "future" suggestions: Implement them now
   - Track progress as you go

5. **Verify Changes**:
   - Run relevant tests for modified files
   - Check that linting/formatting passes
   - Ensure the build still works

6. **Summarize**:
   - List all comments addressed with their resolutions
   - Note any comments that couldn't be addressed and why
   - Prepare a response for the reviewer
