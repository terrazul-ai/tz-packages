Run the project's test suite and analyze any failures.

Steps:
1. Identify the test command from the project configuration
2. Run the full test suite using Bash
3. If tests fail:
   - Analyze the failure output
   - Identify which tests failed and why
   - Read the failing test files
   - Examine the code being tested
   - Provide a detailed analysis of each failure
   - Suggest fixes with explanations
4. If tests pass:
   - Report success
   - Check test coverage if available
   - Suggest areas that might need more test coverage

Provide a structured report:
- **Test Results**: Pass/fail summary
- **Failed Tests** (if any):
  - Test name and location
  - Error message
  - Root cause analysis
  - Suggested fix
- **Coverage** (if available): Current coverage percentage and gaps
- **Recommendations**: Tests to add or improve

Use the debugger agent's expertise for analyzing test failures.
