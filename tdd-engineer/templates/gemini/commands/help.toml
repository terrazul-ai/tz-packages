# @terrazul/tdd-engineer - Package Help

Welcome to the **@terrazul/tdd-engineer** package! This package provides a comprehensive AI coding assistant experience with deep codebase understanding, pragmatic TDD workflow enforcement, and intelligent debugging support.

---

## Quick Overview

This package includes:
- **Dynamic context generation** that analyzes your codebase automatically
- **4 custom commands** for common workflows
- **MCP server integration** (context7, exa, github)
- **Pragmatic TDD workflow** enforcement

---

## Available Commands

### `/run-tests`
**Description**: Runs the project's test suite and analyzes failures

**What it does**:
- Identifies and runs the test command
- Reports pass/fail summary
- Analyzes failing tests with root cause analysis
- Suggests fixes for failures
- Checks test coverage if available

---

### `/debug [error|file]`
**Description**: Debug an error or issue systematically

**What it does**:
- Analyzes error messages and stack traces
- Reproduces the issue if possible
- Identifies root cause
- Suggests concrete fixes with explanations
- Recommends tests to prevent regression

---

### `/review [file|PR]`
**Description**: Review code changes for quality and best practices

**What it does**:
- Reviews specific files or PRs
- Checks code quality, functionality, tests, security
- Identifies issues by priority (Critical > Low)
- Provides specific, actionable feedback

---

### `/address [PR]`
**Description**: Address PR review comments systematically

**What it does**:
- Fetches PR details using GitHub MCP or `gh` CLI
- Gathers all review comments
- Implements fixes for each comment
- Runs tests to verify changes
- Provides summary of addressed comments

---

## MCP Servers

### context7 (Required)
Fetch up-to-date library documentation. Always prefer context7 over web search for library docs.

### exa (Required)
Web research and finding code examples, implementation patterns, and solutions.

### github (Optional)
GitHub integration for fetching PR details, reading issues, and analyzing repositories.

---

## Typical Workflows

### Adding a New Feature
1. Plan the feature
2. Write tests first (RED)
3. Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
4. Refactor while keeping tests green
5. Run `/run-tests` to verify
6. Run `/review` to self-review

### Debugging an Issue
1. Run `/debug [error message]` for initial analysis
2. Implement fix
3. Run `/run-tests` to verify

### Code Review
1. Run `/review [file or PR URL]`
2. Address feedback
3. Re-review until satisfied

### Addressing PR Feedback
1. Run `/address [PR URL or number]`
2. Run `/run-tests` to verify
3. Commit and push

---

## Best Practices

- **Always** write tests for features and bug fixes
- Try max 3 times, then STOP and ask for help
- Keep functions short (<60 lines)
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use context7 first for library documentation
