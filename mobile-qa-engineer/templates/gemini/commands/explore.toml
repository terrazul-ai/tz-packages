Perform full exploration and assessment of the mobile app.

**Usage**: `/explore [options]`

**Arguments**: {{args}}

## Workflow

### Step 1: Device Setup

1. List available devices using `mobile_list_available_devices`
2. Select appropriate device based on target platform
3. Launch the app with the configured bundle ID

### Step 2: Systematic Exploration

Use breadth-first exploration:

1. Capture launch screen (screenshot + UI elements)
2. Identify navigation elements:
   - Tab bars
   - Navigation buttons
   - Menu items
3. Visit each reachable screen:
   - Navigate systematically
   - Screenshot each unique screen
   - Document navigation path
4. Track visited screens to avoid loops

### Step 3: Design Evaluation

For each screen, assess:

- **Touch Targets**: iOS 44x44 points, Android 48x48 dp
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Information structure, spacing
- **Design Consistency**: Colors, button styles, patterns

### Step 4: UX Assessment

- Navigation clarity
- Task efficiency
- Feedback quality
- Error handling

### Step 5: Bug Detection

Look for:
- App crashes
- UI rendering issues
- Layout problems
- Placeholder text
- Broken images

### Step 6: Generate Report

Create exploration report with:
- Summary of screens found
- Navigation map
- Design observations
- Issues found with severity
- Recommendations

## Output

- Exploration report with screen catalog
- Screenshots of all discovered screens
- Bug reports for issues found
- Navigation documentation
