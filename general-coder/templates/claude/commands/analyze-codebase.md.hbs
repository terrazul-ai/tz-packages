Perform a comprehensive analysis of the codebase.

Use the Explore subagent to:
1. Analyze the overall project structure and organization
2. Identify key directories and their purposes
3. Map out the technology stack and dependencies
4. Find important configuration files
5. Identify the main entry points and core modules
6. Note any patterns, conventions, or architectural decisions
7. Highlight areas that might need attention or improvement

Provide a structured report with:
- **Project Structure**: Directory layout and organization
- **Technology Stack**: Languages, frameworks, and tools used
- **Key Components**: Main modules and their responsibilities
- **Patterns & Conventions**: Code organization and naming patterns
- **Dependencies**: External libraries and their usage
- **Potential Issues**: Technical debt, inconsistencies, or concerns
- **Recommendations**: Suggested improvements or areas to investigate

Use context7 and exa MCP servers to research unfamiliar libraries or patterns found in the codebase.
