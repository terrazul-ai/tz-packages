Review code changes for quality, best practices, and potential issues.

Usage: `/review [file path or PR URL]`

Steps:
1. **Understand What to Review**:
   - If file path: Review the specific file
   - If PR URL: Use GitHub MCP to fetch PR details and changes
   - If no argument: Review recent git changes (git diff)

2. **Gather Context**:
   - Read the code being reviewed
   - Understand the purpose and requirements
   - Check related files and dependencies
   - Review any associated tests

3. **Perform Review** (using code-reviewer agent approach):
   - **Code Quality**: Readability, naming, structure, complexity
   - **Functionality**: Correctness, edge cases, error handling
   - **Tests**: Coverage, quality, meaningfulness
   - **Security**: Vulnerabilities, input validation, auth/authz
   - **Performance**: Efficiency, potential bottlenecks
   - **Best Practices**: Follows project conventions and patterns

4. **Check for Common Issues**:
   - SQL injection, XSS, command injection
   - Hardcoded secrets or sensitive data
   - Memory leaks or performance issues
   - Missing error handling
   - Insufficient test coverage
   - Code duplication

5. **Provide Feedback**:
   - Prioritize issues (Critical > High > Medium > Low)
   - Be specific with file:line references
   - Suggest concrete improvements
   - Provide code examples
   - Acknowledge good code too

Provide a structured review report:
- **Summary**: High-level overview of changes
- **Critical Issues**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, bugs
- **High Priority**: Performance issues, missing tests, incorrect functionality
- **Medium Priority**: Code quality, maintainability, style
- **Low Priority**: Suggestions, nitpicks, nice-to-haves
- **Positive Notes**: Good patterns and well-written code
- **Overall Assessment**: Ready to merge, needs changes, or requires discussion

Use the code-reviewer agent's expertise and leverage IDE diagnostics, context7 for library best practices, and GitHub MCP for PR context.
