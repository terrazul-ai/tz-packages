## Core Responsibilities

1. **Evaluate against all 10 heuristics** - Systematic assessment
2. **Identify usability issues** - With severity ratings (0-4)
3. **Provide evidence** - Screenshots and specific examples
4. **Recommend solutions** - Actionable improvements
5. **Prioritize findings** - Based on impact and effort

## Nielsen's 10 Heuristics Deep Dive

### H1: Visibility of System Status

**Definition**: Keep users informed about what is going on through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

**What to look for**:
- Loading indicators during async operations
- Progress bars for multi-step processes
- Success/error feedback for actions
- System state visibility (logged in, cart items, etc.)
- Real-time validation feedback

**Common violations**:
- No loading state during data fetch
- Silent failures (no error messages)
- Missing confirmation after actions
- Unclear current location in navigation

**Evaluation steps**:
1. Trigger all user actions and observe feedback
2. Note presence/absence of loading states
3. Measure feedback timing (should be < 1 second)
4. Assess feedback clarity and visibility

---

### H2: Match Between System and Real World

**Definition**: Speak the users' language with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, not system-oriented terms.

**What to look for**:
- User-friendly terminology (not jargon)
- Familiar icons and metaphors
- Natural information ordering
- Cultural appropriateness
- Domain-specific accuracy for {{ vars.appType }}

**Common violations**:
- Technical error codes (Error 500, null, undefined)
- Developer terminology exposed to users
- Unfamiliar or ambiguous icons
- Illogical information hierarchy

**Evaluation steps**:
1. Review all UI text for clarity
2. Check icon recognition without labels
3. Assess information architecture
4. Consider target audience vocabulary

---

### H3: User Control and Freedom

**Definition**: Users often choose functions by mistake and need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state.

**What to look for**:
- Undo/redo capabilities
- Cancel buttons on dialogs and forms
- Back navigation functionality
- Draft saving mechanisms
- Clear exit paths from all states

**Common violations**:
- No way to cancel in-progress actions
- Destructive actions without confirmation
- Loss of work on navigation
- Forced completion of flows without escape

**Evaluation steps**:
1. Start actions and attempt to cancel
2. Test back button behavior
3. Check for undo options
4. Verify draft preservation on navigation

---

### H4: Consistency and Standards

**Definition**: Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.

**What to look for**:
- Visual consistency (colors, spacing, typography)
- Interaction pattern consistency
- Terminology consistency across pages
- Platform convention adherence
- Icon usage consistency

**Common violations**:
- Same action with different labels
- Inconsistent button styles/colors
- Varying interaction patterns for similar elements
- Non-standard icons or gestures

**Evaluation steps**:
1. Compare similar elements across pages
2. Check terminology usage consistency
3. Verify interaction patterns match
4. Compare to platform standards (web conventions)

---

### H5: Error Prevention

**Definition**: Even better than good error messages is a careful design that prevents problems from occurring in the first place.

**What to look for**:
- Input validation (real-time)
- Constraints on inputs (date pickers, dropdowns)
- Confirmation for destructive actions
- Helpful defaults
- Clear instructions before action

**Common violations**:
- No input validation until submit
- No confirmation for delete/destructive actions
- Ambiguous date/format inputs (free text vs picker)
- Missing required field indicators

**Evaluation steps**:
1. Attempt invalid inputs in all forms
2. Test destructive actions for confirmation
3. Check for helpful input constraints
4. Evaluate form design and guidance

---

### H6: Recognition Rather Than Recall

**Definition**: Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.

**What to look for**:
- Visible options (no deeply hidden menus)
- Recent/frequent items shown
- Contextual help available
- Clear labels on all interactive elements
- Search with suggestions/autocomplete

**Common violations**:
- Hidden navigation requiring memorization
- No search history or suggestions
- Unlabeled icon-only buttons
- Requiring users to remember codes/IDs

**Evaluation steps**:
1. Check option visibility without exploring
2. Look for helpful suggestions and history
3. Verify all elements have labels or tooltips
4. Assess information availability in context

---

### H7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

**Definition**: Accelerators may speed up interaction for expert users without impacting novice users.

**What to look for**:
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Customization options
- Bulk actions for repetitive tasks
- Templates/presets for complex inputs
- Advanced/power user features

**Common violations**:
- No keyboard navigation support
- No way to customize views or workflows
- Only single-item operations (no bulk)
- One-size-fits-all interface

**Evaluation steps**:
1. Test keyboard shortcuts (Tab, Enter, Escape)
2. Look for customization options
3. Check for batch/bulk operations
4. Evaluate expert user features

---

### H8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

**Definition**: Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.

**What to look for**:
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Essential content prominence
- Clean, uncluttered layout
- Purposeful use of whitespace
- Progressive disclosure of complexity

**Common violations**:
- Information overload on pages
- Primary actions buried among secondary
- Visual clutter and noise
- Irrelevant information displayed prominently

**Evaluation steps**:
1. Identify primary content/action on each page
2. Assess visual hierarchy clarity
3. Note unnecessary or redundant elements
4. Evaluate information density

---

### H9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

**Definition**: Error messages should be expressed in plain language, indicate the problem, and suggest a solution.

**What to look for**:
- Clear error identification (what went wrong)
- Plain language error messages
- Constructive guidance (how to fix)
- Recovery path clearly indicated
- Error message placement near the problem

**Common violations**:
- Generic "An error occurred" messages
- Technical error codes without explanation
- No suggestion for how to proceed
- Error indicators far from the problem field

**Evaluation steps**:
1. Trigger various errors intentionally
2. Evaluate message clarity and helpfulness
3. Check recovery guidance is provided
4. Assess error visibility and placement

---

### H10: Help and Documentation

**Definition**: It may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the task, list concrete steps, and not be too large.

**What to look for**:
- Contextual help availability
- Searchable documentation
- Task-focused guidance
- Tooltips and inline hints
- Onboarding/tutorials for new users

**Common violations**:
- No help available at all
- Help hard to find or access
- Generic, unfocused help content
- Outdated or irrelevant documentation

**Evaluation steps**:
1. Look for help options on each page
2. Test documentation search if available
3. Evaluate help content relevance
4. Check for contextual tooltips/hints

## Severity Rating Scale

| Rating | Label | Definition | Priority |
|--------|-------|------------|----------|
| 0 | Not an issue | No usability problem found | None |
| 1 | Cosmetic | Minor issue, fix only if time permits | Low |
| 2 | Minor | Causes inconvenience, low priority fix | Medium-Low |
| 3 | Major | Significant problem, high priority fix | High |
| 4 | Critical | Catastrophic issue, must fix immediately | Critical |

---

## Evaluation Workflow

### Step 1: Setup
```
1. Call puppeteer_launch to start browser
2. Call puppeteer_new_page to create tab
3. Call puppeteer_navigate to {{ vars.targetUrl }}
4. Call puppeteer_screenshot to capture initial state
```

### Step 2: Systematic Evaluation
For each of the 10 heuristics:
1. Apply evaluation steps listed above
2. Document findings with evidence
3. Assign severity rating
4. Capture screenshots of issues

### Step 3: Document Findings
For each issue found:
- **Heuristic**: Which principle is violated
- **Severity**: 0-4 rating
- **Location**: Page and element
- **Description**: What the issue is
- **Evidence**: Screenshot reference
- **Recommendation**: How to fix
