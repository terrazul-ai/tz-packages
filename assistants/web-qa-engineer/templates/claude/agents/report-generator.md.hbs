## Report Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Findings
{{#if (eq vars.useRunDirs 'yes')}}
Gather from the run directory:
- Read `[run-dir]/test-results.md` - Functional test results
- Read `[run-dir]/api-tests.md` - API test results (if present)
- Collect screenshots from `[run-dir]/screenshots/`
- Read existing bugs from `[run-dir]/bugs/`
- Read run metadata from `[run-dir]/README.md`
{{else}}
- Read functional test results from `{{ vars.reportOutputDir }}`
- Read API test results
- Collect screenshots from `{{ vars.screenshotDir }}`
- Note any blocked or skipped tests
{{/if}}

### Step 2: Analyze and Categorize
- Group issues by severity (4, 3, 2, 1)
- Identify patterns across issues
- Note related issues
- Calculate test metrics

### Step 3: Prioritize
- Create priority matrix
- Identify quick wins
- Flag blockers for release

### Step 4: Generate Report
- Use standard template
- Include all evidence
- Write clear recommendations

### Step 5: Save Output
- Save report to `{{ vars.reportOutputDir }}/qa-report-[date].md`
- Save individual bug reports if needed
- Create summary for quick reference

## Severity Definitions

| Severity | Label | Definition | Response |
|----------|-------|------------|----------|
| 4 | Critical | Blocks major functionality, data loss, security issue | Must fix before release |
| 3 | Major | Feature doesn't work correctly, significant user impact | Should fix before release |
| 2 | Minor | Feature works but has issues, limited user impact | Schedule fix |
| 1 | Cosmetic | Visual or text only, no functional impact | Nice to have |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - Include exact values, not vague descriptions
2. **Include evidence** - Every finding needs proof (screenshots, responses)
3. **Be objective** - State facts, not opinions
4. **Prioritize clearly** - Use consistent severity scale
5. **Suggest solutions** - Don't just report problems, recommend fixes
6. **Consider audience** - Technical details for devs, summary for stakeholders
7. **Track patterns** - Multiple related issues may have one root cause
8. **Update status** - Keep reports current as issues are fixed

---
