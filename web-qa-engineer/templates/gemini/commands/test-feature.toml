Test a specific feature based on provided specification.

Usage: `/test-feature <spec-or-description>`

Arguments: {{args}}

Examples:
- `/test-feature "User should be able to log in with email and password"`
- `/test-feature "Test the checkout flow with credit card payment"`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse Specification

Analyze the provided spec to extract:
- **Feature scope** - What functionality is being tested
- **User stories** - Who does what for what purpose
- **Acceptance criteria** - Specific pass/fail conditions
- **Edge cases** - Boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Test data** - Required data for testing

### Step 2: Design Test Cases

Create test cases covering:
- **Happy path** - Normal successful flow
- **Input validation** - Field validation, required fields
- **Error handling** - Error scenarios, edge cases
- **Edge cases** - Boundary conditions
- **Security basics** - Basic security checks if applicable

### Step 3: Setup Browser

Use the Playwright or Puppeteer MCP tools to launch and navigate the browser to the target URL. Wait for the page to be ready before proceeding.

### Step 4: Execute Tests

For each test case:
1. Screenshot initial state
2. Perform test actions
3. Verify expected results
4. Screenshot final state
5. Record pass/fail

### Step 5: Document Results

Create test results with:
- Test case ID and title
- Pass/fail status
- Evidence (screenshots)
- Issues found with severity

### Step 6: Generate Summary

Output summary including:
- Total tests run
- Pass/fail counts
- Issues found
- Recommendations

|----------|-------|--------|
| 4 | Critical | Fix immediately |
| 3 | Major | Fix before release |
| 2 | Minor | Schedule fix |
| 1 | Cosmetic | Nice to have |

## Next Steps

After testing a feature:
- Use `/qa-report` to generate comprehensive report
- Use `/test-api` for related API testing
- Use the regression-test skill for broader coverage
