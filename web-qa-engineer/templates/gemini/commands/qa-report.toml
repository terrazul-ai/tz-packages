### Step 2: Analyze Results

Calculate metrics:
- Total tests executed
- Pass/fail counts and percentages
- Issue counts by severity (4, 3, 2, 1)
- Test coverage by feature/endpoint
- Identify patterns across issues

### Step 3: Generate Report

#### Executive Summary
```markdown
## Executive Summary

### Overall Status: [PASS / PASS WITH ISSUES / FAIL]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tests | X |
| Passed | X (X%) |
| Failed | X (X%) |
| Critical Issues | X |

### Key Findings
1. [Finding 1]
2. [Finding 2]

### Recommendation
[Ship / Fix first / Investigate]
```

#### Detailed Report
- Complete test coverage
- All issues with full details
- Priority matrix
- Remediation recommendations

#### Bug Reports
